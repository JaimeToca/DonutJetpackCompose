# DonutJetpackCompose
This is a flying spinning donut created using Jetpack Compose.

The basic steps are :

1. Create a circle of radius R1 centered at R2
2. Create a donut ([torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#:~:text=In%20geometry%2C%20a%20torus%20(plural,called%20a%20torus%20of%20revolution.)))
3. Spin the donut (x and z axis)
4. Project donut onto 2D screen

Illumination, animation and performance improvements are still in progress. (PR are welcome too)

I recommend you check out [Andy's blog](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) on the mathematics behind a spinning torus.
